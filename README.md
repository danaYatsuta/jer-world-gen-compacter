This is a small Python script to compact output of [RegionScanner](https://github.com/RundownRhino/RegionScanner).

It removes all non-ore entries (assumes that ore blocks have "ore" in the name), and if an ore has a deepslate variant (assumes that it follows "modname:deepslate_ore_name" format), makes "distrib" value of both variants a sum of individual variants' "distrib" values.

To use, put `world-gen.json` generated by RegionScanner into the same directory as the script and run the script. Compacted `world-gen.json` will be saved in `world-gen-compacted.json` in the same directory.
